# 07-Node JS Readme Creator

## Description

I created a node JS application that creates a command-line application to dynamically generate a professional Readme.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This application allows the project creator more time to work on the project by outlining what the creator needs to make a quality readme.md file. This ensures the creator more time to focus on the project. The readme creator is targeted for other software developers like myself who want to jumpstart the readme writing process.


## Usage 
Here is a walkthrough video on how to use this application.
